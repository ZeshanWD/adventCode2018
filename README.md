## Advent Code 2018

I'm doing the advent challenge of this year, while learning a new programming language. 

The purpose of this challenge is to practise my problem solving skills and also to learn the Go programming Language. Actually I have no experience with Go, but It's looks very interesting language to me. So far it has been great for me so I will continue doing this challenges :(
